~~ Magic University (unnamed)

A dating sim slash fantasy life sim slash procgen dungeon game. we'll see how it goes. kind of like the sims x rimworld x a general dating sim?

## Characters
Characters are the autonomous inhabitants of the magic university. 

Characters have Avatars, which are their physical presence in the game. Most Avatars are moving bodies with physical needs, 
though perhaps a few Characters will have Avatars that do not function like this, e.g. something like a sentient personification of the University's walls, or ghosts.

Characters' minds are composed of Needs, Feelings, Thoughts, Actions, Memories, Personality Traits, and Rules.
Personality Traits are created into the Character and are influenced by their Culture. Needs are uncreated and change by the Environment. The Environment can produce Thoughts and Feelings. Needs can produce Feelings. Various mental circumstances can produce Feelings. Thoughts can produce Feelings, and Feelings can produce new Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Memories, and Memories can produce Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Actions. Memories can change Personality Traits. Personality Traits can motivate Thoughts. 

Rules are a final special category which prevent certain actions from happening, cause certain actions to happen, and influence Thoughts. Rules are created by Memories and Personality Traits, and Memories can change Rules. They can also be generated by Culture.

### Needs
Needs are basic inherent things the Character keeps track of and which produce Feelings. They are scalar values from 0 to 100. As they get lower, they increase certain Feelings. Some Needs are listed as Mortal, meaning a Character will prioritize them far more than other Needs. Non-mortal Needs can be affected by Personality Traits, which may decrease or increase their thresholds for making Feelings.

Some Needs and their general descriptions:
* Breath (Mortal): The need for a Character's Avatar to breathe
* Hydration (Mortal): The need for a Character's Avatar to drink water
* Satiation (Mortal): The need for a Character's Avatar to eat food

### Feelings
Feelings are basic environmental circumstances in a character that affect how they think and act, reducing or increasing the likelihoods of certain kinds of actions. 
Feelings simply are measurable as scalar values from 0 to 100 in general.

### Thoughts
Thoughts come in different basic kinds, and they have an associated Feeling (or set thereof) that they are expected to create. They are also temporary, except when they create memories. Thoughts can have Topics, which are Characters and objects. They also have a Timestamp, which is a calendar date they are linked to, and can be marked as Lie if a Character has figured out that someone they're talking to is lying, or as Dubious if they are just suspicious. 

(Maybe theta-roles? I.e. who is the agent, experiencer, patient, instrument, and theme? For better organization so we don't have Characters hating someone who was killed instead of their killer?)

Thoughts can also have a *Source* if they are told by someone else. However, the Source may become forgotten.

A *Metathought* is a special kind of Thought that is about another Thought. Metathoughts usually represent hypotheticals, such as questions or desires. They are topically associated with the same Topics as their contained Thought, but usually influence the mind and actions differently.

All thoughts are generated with randomness and different weights based on personality traits, but before being deployed in the mind they check conditions to determine if they are appropriate. If not, they are not deployed in the mind.

### Rules
Rules are simplistic relationships that consist of a *Cause* and an *Effect*. The Effect is usually marked with Feelings. Rules indicate the Character's understanding of the world. They may be marked with a *Strength* value, where Stronger Rules will take precedence over weaker Rules if they come in conflict (i.e. are applied to the same situation but the resultant thoughts , though the character will get the thought "I have ignored <rule>" when this happens. Rules can be created and deleted, though they tend to get recreated by the "I must follow <rule>" thought.

The *Probability* score indicates how likely the Cause is to cause the Effect. Furthermore, both the Cause and Effect are structures as Thoughts--although Effect might just be "bad consequences" or "good consequences"

The "Topics" of the Cause and Effect need not be individuals, but can also be *Templates*, which are just marked by logical relations, i.e. and/or/not, and usually encompass what Kind of thing the Topic is, and what Statuses it might have.

### Actions

#### Dialogue
Dialogue is a way to convey information or change emotions. *Simple-statements* are small dialogues meant to influence emotions, but which don't convey information, whereas *Info-statements* are dialogues which convey information. 

Dialogue can be held between two or more individuals, and can be held either by directly being in the presence of an individual, or through communicative means.

Simple-statements include:

### Memories
Memories are stored Thoughts, and can be periodically recalled, causing the emotions in their thought to surface again.
Memories are stored with links to their Topics, so that a Topic can be used to access a memory about it. 

Memories also can be formed with causal links, i.e. relations that indicate what other memory caused this memory. This can be to denote events caused by other events, e.g. [*Max* is *dead*] -:CAUSE:-> [*John* did *killing* to *Max*]; or it can denote simply that a memory was generated by a feeling produced by another memory, e.g. [*I* feel *attraction*] -:CAUSE:-> [*John* said *compliment* about *me*], as a result of the Character thinking about [John said compliment about me], feeling happiness, happiness motivating a thought of attraction. 

Memories have *Salience* which determines whether they are accessed earlier or later in relation to their topic. Salience is determined largely by the strength of the emotion associated with the Topic, as well as with the general Salience stat of the type of thought itself.

Relationship Memory is a datum associated with each Topic that periodically gets the average emotional values of each memory under a Topic weighted by Salience, and also sums up the Salience, and stores those to determine which Topics are most significant and what the general feeling about those topics is.

#### Topics
*Topics*, as have been discussed multiple times, are other Characters, Objects, or Places. Topic Memory is a collection of Topics the character knows, and also Concepts, which are topics that the Character does not have confirmation of, and which may or may not refer to real things. Concepts are stored as Names initially, indicating a Character knows nothing about them, and then as Concepts with a value of Dubiousness indicating how likely they are to exist. Concepts usually are passed in Culture, and when they are referenced a Character produces a Thought about knowledge about them if they don't know what they are, and a Thought about their realness.

### Personality Traits


## Avatars

### Statuses

## University
The University is the setting of the game and has systems that it upholds and which characters interact with.
## World
The World is everything outside the University, which is mainly inaccessible to the player directly. However, there will be Characters who come from the World and interact with Characters in the University.

Furthermore, there will be events in the World. Currently uncertain, but possibilities include:
* Political events that impact University regulations, funding, and conversations with other Characters about beliefs
* Maybe even a greater scale plot generation system that can allow for events like Rimworld, and can allow Characters to die and be in danger.
* Perhaps events that affect the magic system itself.
