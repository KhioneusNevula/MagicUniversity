~~ Magic University (unnamed)

A dating sim slash fantasy life sim slash procgen dungeon game. we'll see how it goes. kind of like the sims x rimworld x a general dating sim?

## Characters
Characters are the autonomous inhabitants of the magic university. 

Characters have Avatars, which are their physical presence in the game. Most Avatars are moving bodies with physical needs, 
though perhaps a few Characters will have Avatars that do not function like this, e.g. something like a sentient personification of the University's walls, or ghosts.

Characters' minds are composed of Feelings, Thoughts, Actions, and Memories (FTAM).
The Environment can produce Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Feelings, and Feelings can produce new Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Memories, and Memories can produce Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Actions.

### Feelings
Feelings are basic environmental circumstances in a character that affect how they think and act, reducing or increasing the likelihoods of certain kinds of actions. 
Feelings simply are measurable as scalar values from 0 to 100.

### Thoughts

### Actions

### Memories



### Living Characters


## University
The University is the setting of the game and has systems that it upholds and which characters interact with.
## World
The World is everything outside the University, which is mainly inaccessible to the player directly. However, there will be Characters who come from the World and interact with Characters in the University.

Furthermore, there will be events in the World. Currently uncertain, but possibilities include:
* Political events that impact University regulations, funding, and conversations with other Characters about beliefs
* Maybe even a greater scale plot generation system that can allow for events like Rimworld, and can allow Characters to die and be in danger.
* Perhaps events that affect the magic system itself.
