A dating sim slash fantasy life sim slash procgen dungeon game. we'll see how it goes. kind of like the sims x rimworld x a general dating sim?

## Characters
Characters are the autonomous inhabitants of the magic university. 

Characters have Avatars, which are their physical presence in the game. Most Avatars are moving bodies with physical needs, 
though perhaps a few Characters will have Avatars that do not function like this, e.g. something like a sentient personification of the University's walls, or ghosts.

Characters' minds are composed of Needs, Feelings, Thoughts, Actions, Memories, and Personality Traits. (NFTAMP).
Personality Traits are created into the Character. Needs are uncreated and change by the Environment. The Environment can produce Thoughts and Feelings. Needs can produce Feelings. Various mental circumstances can produce Feelings. Thoughts can produce Feelings, and Feelings can produce new Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Memories, and Memories can produce Thoughts. Thoughts can produce Actions. Memories can change Personality Traits. 

### Needs
Needs are basic inherent things the Character keeps track of and which produce Feelings. They are scalar values from 0 to 100. As they get lower, they increase certain Feelings. Some Needs are listed as Mortal, meaning a Character will prioritize them far more than other Needs. Non-mortal Needs can be affected by Personality Traits, which may decrease or increase their thresholds for making Feelings.

Some Needs and their general descriptions:

### Thoughts
Thoughts come in different basic kinds, and they have an associated Feeling (or set thereof) that they are expected to create. They are also temporary, except when they create memories. Thoughts can have Topics, which are Characters and objects.

### Actions

### Memories
Memories are stored Thoughts, and can be periodically recalled, causing the emotions in their thought to surface again.
Memories are stored with links to their Topics, so that a Topic can be used to access a memory about it. 

Memories have *Salience* which determines whether they are accessed earlier or later in relation to their topic. Salience is determined largely by the strength of the emotion associated with the Topic, as well as with the general Salience stat of the type of thought itself.

Relationship Memory is a datum associated with each Topic that periodically gets the average emotional values of each memory under a Topic weighted by Salience, and also sums up the Salience, and stores those to determine which Topics are most significant and what the general feeling about those topics is.

### Personality Traits


### Avatars


## University
The University is the setting of the game and has systems that it upholds and which characters interact with.
## World
The World is everything outside the University, which is mainly inaccessible to the player directly. However, there will be Characters who come from the World and interact with Characters in the University.

Furthermore, there will be events in the World. Currently uncertain, but possibilities include:
* Political events that impact University regulations, funding, and conversations with other Characters about beliefs
* Maybe even a greater scale plot generation system that can allow for events like Rimworld, and can allow Characters to die and be in danger.
* Perhaps events that affect the magic system itself.
